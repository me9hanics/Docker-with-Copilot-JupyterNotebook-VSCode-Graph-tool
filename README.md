# Graph-tool-Docker-with-JupyterNotebook-Copilot-VSCode
Running the Python library "graph-tool" in VSCode using Docker containers (e.g. from Windows) with extensions: Jupyter Notebooks (inside VSCode) and Github Copilot for fast code completion.

This way, one can use the library on Windows in a container, but keep the benefits of using tools such as GitHub Copilot to develop quicker.


## How to setup:

To be added...

## Adding more extensions

To add other extensions and not just Python, Jupyter Notebook and GitHub Copilot, extend the down below section in the devcontainer.json file in the .devcontainer folder:

```"customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
            ...#your extensions
            ]
```

## Docker image
